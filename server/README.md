# Introduction

Hello, fellow traverser of the fog! I couldn't find a reliable, up-to-date Dead By Daylight API and needed a project to work on, so I bring this offering. My goal was for this API to be a robust wealth of Dead By Daylight data for other developers to utilize in their own endeavors. Below I will do my best to explain in detail how each of the routes work to make this API an easy tool for people to use. I will do my best to update data as it is adjusted per update, but alas, I am human and may miss some things; that being said, some TODOs include: items, offerings, and add-ons. If you don't find the answer to your question below, or if you have any comments, feedback, or just want to share something you built while using this API, please feel free to reach out to me [here](https://joecalvi.dev). All rights to any and all of this information belong to Behaviour Interactive, and I do not claim to be the author of any of it. Thank you for stopping by and good luck in your next one!
