            Hello, fellow traverser of the fog! I couldn't find a reliable Dead By Daylight API and needed a project to work on, so here we are. I aimed for this API to be a robust wealth of Dead By Daylight data for other developers to utilize in their own endeavors. I will do my best to update data as it is adjusted per update, but alas, I am human and may miss some things. Some TODOs include: items, offerings, and add-ons. If you have any notes, comments, feedback, or you just want to share something you built while using this API, please feel free to reach out to me <a class="text-dbd" href="https://joecalvi.dev">here</a>. Thanks for stopping by and good luck in your next one!

The Foundry and Mine were the heart and centre of the estate. Those unlucky enough to be employed by Archie MacMillan slowly started to slip away from all kinds of normal life. Wives asking for their husbands to come home. Archie MacMillan began to obsess. His life was built around and on top of the Mine and Foundry. One day the former workers, now slaves, were not allowed to leave the premises without permission. Fences and goons made sure of it. Objections were rewarded with a visit to the furnace. Questions and rumours arose in town. But no answers. One fewer worker, missed by maybe a poor widow was not enough for real actions. Finally Archie MacMillan snapped and sealed his workers in the Mine. Suffocating them. Archie MacMillan's remains were later found. A silent skeleton with a taunting grin upon his meat less skull. What is left of the Estate are now but mere ruins and myths. Teens enter the area from time to time in a game of dare, bringing back new information about what is happening at the Estate. Because somehow, it seems like something is happening there. Even though not really understandable to the simple, human eye and mind.",

Selected for its breathable air, its valuable minerals, and its beautiful lakes and forests, Dvarka looked to be the perfect planet for a new start for humanity. But exploration of the surface revealed a dark secret: an advanced civilization, completely wiped out by some unknown event. The ship lies surrounded by strange rock formations on the alien soil of Dvarka, the light of its sun choked out by giant, twisting trees. And in the darkness, a new threat emerges: an Earth invention, twisted by alien technology, unflagging in its mission to end human life on Dvarka and beyond.",
